# Write a program that asks the user to enter the principal amount, the annual interest rate (as a percentage), and the time in years. Calculate the simple interest using the formula SI=(P×R×T)/100​ and print the result.
#
# Expected Output:
#
#
# Enter the principal amount: 1000
# Enter the interest rate (%): 5
# Enter the time (years): 3
# The simple interest is 150.0
