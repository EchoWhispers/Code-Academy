# Calculate compound interest from principal, annual rate, and time provided by the user, and display the resulting amount.
#
# Compound interest is a method of calculating interest whereby the interest earned over time is added to the principal balance. Interest is then calculated on the new balance, which includes both the original principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. This process of adding interest to the principal is known as compounding.
#
# Example Calculation:
# Suppose you invest $1,000 (the principal) at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded annually for 3 years.
#
# Convert the interest rate: 5% as a decimal is 0.05.
#
# Determine the compounding frequency: Compounded annually, so ùëõ=1n=1.
#
# Apply the formula:
#
#
# The total amount accumulated after 3 years is approximately $1,157.63.
#
# The interest earned would be $157.63 ($1,157.63 - $1,000).
#
#
# Enter the principal amount: 1000
# Enter the annual interest rate (as a decimal): 0.05
# Enter the time in years: 3
# The amount after 3 years is 1157.63.
